This project is inspired by [Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling by Liu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12027). It purpose is to implement and test the framework of a DRL based reccomendation system.

To test the code first of all get the ```ratings.csv``` file from [MovieLens Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and run:

``
